### Resonant Ontology System for Etymological Topology Tokenization of Acoustic Signals

**R.O.S.E.T.T.A.S.** is a quantitative signal processing research suite designed to discover the foundational isomorphisms between sound, geometry, and linguistic meaning. At its core lies **G.A.T.E.** (Geometric Acoustic Topology Engine), a real-time transduction system that bypasses cultural semantics to analyze the raw physical efficiency of acoustic waveforms.

## 🔬 Scientific Abstract: From Translation to Transduction

Traditional linguistics relies on **Translation**—the mapping of arbitrary acoustic symbols to culturally relative concepts. ROSETTAS proposes **Transduction**—the direct conversion of acoustic pressure fields into topological invariants. We seek the "Vibrational Constants" of language: patterns where sound geometry locks into standing wave modes that minimize entropy.

## 🛠 Core Architecture: G.A.T.E.

### 1. GPGPU Resonant Field (100k Particles)
The system offloads the **Helmholtz Wave Equation** to the GPU via vertex shaders. By computing polynomial approximations of **Bessel Functions of the First Kind ($J_n$)**, G.A.T.E. visualizes acoustic topology at a density of 100,000 particles per frame, revealing nodal loops and persistent manifolds.

### 2. Persistent Homology & Betti Numbers
Utilizing principles from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), we extract noise-robust invariants:
- **$\beta_0$ (Betti 0):** Connected spectral components forming the fundamental structural nucleus.
- **$\beta_1$ (Betti 1):** Persistent nodal loops indicating harmonic complexity and non-trivial symmetry.

### 3. Bayesian Non-Parametric Quantization
Incoming signals are processed through an adaptive **DP-means (Dirichlet Process Means)** clustering algorithm. This allows the system to discover new "Acoustic Archetypes" ($\Psi$-clusters) in real-time without a pre-defined limit on the number of possible structural tokens.

### 4. The Diamond Protocol (Falsifiability)
To ensure scientific rigor, all detected patterns are subjected to the **Diamond Protocol**—a Block-Shuffle Monte Carlo test. This compares the signal's native structural delta against randomized null hypotheses to calculate a $Z$-Score of statistical significance, filtering out stochastic artifacts.

## 🤖 The AI-Scientist Module

ROSETTAS utilizes a multi-agent framework powered by **Gemini-3-Pro-Preview** to interpret the discovered topologies:

*   **Agent Logos (Philologist):** Analyzes the etymological evolution of sound and geometric isomorphisms in ancient phonemes.
*   **Agent Vibra (Acoustician):** Specializes in resonance physics, interpreting Betti numbers as physical indicators of information density.
*   **Agent Synthe (Synthesizer):** Coordinates findings to propose the "Rosetta Stone"—the unified principle of matter-sound interaction.

## 🚀 Technical Configuration

Physical constants are managed via `config.yaml`, allowing runtime adjustments to the experimental baseline:
- **Baseline:** 432.0 Hz (Harmonic Mean)
- **Quantizer Lambda:** 0.75 (Sensitivity for new archetype discovery)
- **TDA Precision:** 0.01

## ⚖️ Philosophical Framework

ROSETTAS operates under the **Vibrational Constant Paradigm**, suggesting that certain acoustic structures (found in whale click-trains, ancient chants, and biological signals) share a universal grammar written into the medium of the vacuum itself.
